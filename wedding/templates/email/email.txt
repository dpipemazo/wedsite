~Chinese New Year & Shabbat Dinner~

We have the following people attending our Chinese New Year / Shabbat dinner on 2/16/18:
{% for person in attending_cny %}
    - {{ person.name }}
{% endfor %}

We'll be gathering at 7:00PM at:
Empress Harbor Restaurant
111 N Atlantic Blvd #350
Monterey Park, CA 91754

Parking is free in the structure beneath the restaurant. After parking, you can take the escalators or stairs up to the third floor to find the restaurant.

After dinner (around 8:30PM) we will walk a few shops down to get boba at:
Half and Half Tea House
141 N Atlantic Blvd #112
Monterey Park, CA 91754

Please note that traffic in Los Angeles can be a bit challenging and that Monterey Park is a bit of a drive from the wedding venue and hotels. Best case from the Redondo/Hermosa beach area is 40 minutes, the more likely case is closer to an hour on a Friday evening. Please plan accordingly!
