	<h2> Chinese New Year & Shabbat Dinner </h2>

	<p>We have the following people attending our Chinese New Year / Shabbat dinner on 2/16/18:</p>
	<ol>
	{% for person in attending_cny %}
		<li>{{ person.name }}</li>
	{% endfor %}
	</ol>

	<p>We'll be gathering at <b>7:00PM</b> at:<br><br>
	<b>Empress Harbor Restaurant</b><br>
	<a href=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Empress+Harbor+Restaurant/@34.0629425,-118.136659,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2c55d6a1b9aa3:0x504f163410e84e1a!8m2!3d34.0629381!4d-118.1344703>111 N Atlantic Blvd #350<br>Monterey Park, CA 91754
	</a></p>

	<p>Parking is free in the structure beneath the restaurant. After parking, you can take the escalators or stairs up to the third floor to find the restaurant.</p>

	<p>After dinner (around 8:30PM), we will walk a few shops down to get boba at:<br><br>
	<b>Half and Half Tea House</b><br>
	<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Half+%26+Half+Tea+House+MP/@34.0636102,-118.1367197,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2c55d72b7cc0d:0x2bf98171d1195ecd!8m2!3d34.0636058!4d-118.134531">141 N Atlantic Blvd #112<br>Monterey Park, CA 91754</a></p>

	<p>Please note that traffic in Los Angeles can be challenging and that Monterey Park is a bit of a drive from the wedding venue and hotels. Best case from the Redondo/Hermosa beach area is 40 minutes, the more likely case is closer to an hour on a Friday evening. Please plan accordingly!</p>
