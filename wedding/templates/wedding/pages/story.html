      <p>
        Thanksgiving, 2014. Dan, having just moved to San Diego a few months
        prior, attended "tygiving," an annual potluck hosted by 
        <a href="/team">Steven Okai</a> that brings together a large group of 
        (mostly Caltech) friends for the holidays. Jennifer was attempting to 
        fix a gravy that another friend had started but long since abandoned. 
        Jennifer, introductions be damned, stopped the first person who passed 
        the kitchen (Dan) and asked, "What does this gravy need?!" Dan came to 
        the rescue, and Jennifer was impressed with the fix.

      <p>
        Jennifer, in an effort to help their friend Steven, hatched a scheme to 
        get Steven a date for Valentine's Day. After surprising Steven with a 
        date from UCSD's annual date auction fundraiser, Jennifer organized a 
        group date (with help from her bridesmaid 
        <a href="/team">Delara Fadavi</a>) to calm Steven's nerves and relax the 
        mood. Out of Steven's three San Diego-based friends, Dan was the 
        "goldilocks" conversationalist, so he came along as Jennifer's date. 
        Dan spent the night telling stories of his and Steven's recent 
        blizzard-filled snowboarding adventures, occasionally also delving into 
        some delightful conversation with Jennifer.

        Parking Lot Date<br>
      </h2>
      <p>
        During the Valentine's Day dinner discussions and thereafter, through 
        countless hours of calls and texts, Dan and Jennifer realized they had 
        a lot in common! One of these common interests is the TV show
        "Avatar: The Last Airbender." A few weeks after the Valentine's Day
        dinner, there was an art exhibition dedicated to the show and its fans
        at an art gallery in Alhambra. Dan invited Jennifer to attend its 
        opening night for their first real date. The gallery opening proved to 
        be a popular event, and Dan and Jennifer got to know each other more 
        while standing in line for <b>four hours</b> in the parking lot. The 
        night ended spectacularly with their first kiss!

      <h2 class="text-center">Dating via Southwest</h2>
      <p>
        The long-distance relationship between Jennifer at UCLA and Dan in San
        Diego seemed reasonable, so the two agreed to give it a shot. Then, Dan
        promptly upended their budding relationship by quitting his job in San 
        Diego to move into groomsman <a href="/team">Sean Keenan</a>'s kitchen 
        in Cupertino and join an early-stage startup. Jennifer was supportive 
        of Dan's career, and spent a majority of her time those first few months 
        on an air mattress in said kitchen while studying for her first board 
        exam. Over the next few years, Dan and Jennifer ping-ponged back and
        forth between LA and SF on weekends. Many a brunch was consumed in the
        dating process.

      <h2 class="text-center">...and back to the Parking Lot</h2>
      <p>
        After toiling through the holidays to prepare his CES 2017 demo, Dan
        managed to take a few days off with Jennifer in LA before heading to the 
        conference. Jennifer planned a Pixar-themed date at the California 
        Science Center's interactive Pixar exhibit, followed by a visit to a 
        Pixar art show at the same art gallery where they first got to know 
        each other. It was pouring rain when they arrived at the gallery, but 
        Dan had other plans. He led Jennifer deep into the parking lot, to the 
        very spot where they had talked for so many hours on their first date. 
        Down on one knee, with Jennifer holding the umbrella, Dan proposed and 
        Jennifer said yes!
