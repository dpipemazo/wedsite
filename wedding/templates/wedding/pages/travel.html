      <h2> Air Travel </h2>
      <p>
      There are two airports which will work well for travelling to the
      wedding: Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Long Beach Airport
      (LGB). Both are roughly equidistant to the ceremony location and lodging,
      30-45 minutes. LAX is served more regularly by all major airlines, while
      LGB is primarily served by JetBlue. LGB is a smaller and more manageable
      airport, but it is recommended to choose a nonstop flight to avoid getting
      caught in a winter delay during a layover.
